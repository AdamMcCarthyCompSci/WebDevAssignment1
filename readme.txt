My website is a personal website concerning my hobby: level design.

§ Links to both your own pages and external webpages.
    I link to my own pages via the navbar and the buttons on the "projects" page.

§ A navigation bar
    The navbar can be found at the top of every page.

§ At least one table used in an appropriate manner
    Tables can be found on the "Project 1" and "Project 2" pages, which can be accessed via the "Projects" page.

§ At least one list (ordered or unordered)
    A list can be seen on the "Project 1" page.

§ At least one local or embedded video
    There are embedded videos on the "Project 1" and "Project 2" pages.

§ At least four CSS3 and four HTML5 specific elements
    4 HTML5 specific elements in the website:
        
        <h3>Level Design</h3> - "Home" page
        
        <p>Enjoy your stay!</p> - "Home" page
        
        <li>Adventure</li> - "Project 1" page
        
        <td>Render Distance</td> - "Project 2" page

    4 CSS3 specific elements in the website:
           
            .hero-text {
            text-align: center;
            position: absolute;
            top: 50%;
            left: 50%;
            transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
            color: white;
            }                                     - Can be found at the top of every page, the text in the middle of the image with the ship.

            .footer {
            padding: 5px;
            text-align: center;
            background: #333;
            margin-top: 20px;
            position: fixed;
            left: 0;
            bottom: 0;
            width: 100%;
            border-radius: 10px;
            }                                       - Can be found at the bottom of every page, where the social media links are held.

            table {
            border-collapse: collapse;
            border-spacing: 0;
            width: 100%;
            border: 1px solid #ddd;
            margin-bottom: 50px;
            }                                       - Can be found on the "Project 1" and "Project 2" pages, displays requirements and recommendations of each map.

            .button {
            position: relative;
            background-color: #555;
            border: none;
            font-size: 20px;
            color: #FFFFFF;
            padding: 10px;
            width: 200px;
            text-align: center;
            transition-duration: 0.4s;
            text-decoration: none;
            overflow: hidden;
            cursor: pointer;
            border-radius: 10px;
            z-index: 1;
            }                                      - Featured in the navbar and also the submit and download buttons.


§ Make use of the CSS positional properties (e.g. position, float)
    Positional properties can be seen throughout the website. For example, the right-oriented "Contacts" button on the navbar, or the absolute positioned text that overlays the hero image.

§ Make use of both inline and block elements
    Block elements are featured throughout the design, for example, in the responsive layout of the gallery. Additionally, inline elements are commonly featured too, for example, the text on the download buttons on the "Project 1" and "Project 2" pages.

d) Going beyond the parts of HTML and CSS described in the lectures and practical classes to explore features of HTML and CSS that make a website responsive.
    
    I explored the entirety of the CSS and HTML courses on W3Schools and learned how to implement many interesting features.
    For example:
        Animated buttons (also react appropriately when mousing over etc.)
        Favicon
        Hero image
        Social media logos with links in the footer
        Contact form (Submit functionality wasn't implemented)
        Fully-responsive design - can fit smaller displays and adapts appropriately. I chose a 2 or 3 column design (depending on the page), which narrows down to 1 column when the display gets narrow enough. Other features such as the navbar are fully-responsive too.
        Blur/opacity/interactive images (On "Projects" page)
        Many more smaller features that I picked up while going through the W3Schools curriculum
